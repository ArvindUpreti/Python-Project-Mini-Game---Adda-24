    "This a fun and interactive Python-based mini cricket game that allows two players to compete in a virtual cricket match with multiple overs options (1, 3, or 5 overs). The game starts with a coin toss to decide which player will bat or bowl first. Players take turns to bat and bowl, with each ball's outcome being determined by random scoring and the player's input to predict the opponent's score."
