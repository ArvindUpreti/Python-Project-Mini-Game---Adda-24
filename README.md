Key Features
Multi-Over Options: Choose between 1, 3, or 5 overs to play short or extended matches.
Coin Toss Decision: The game starts with a virtual coin toss to decide which player will bat or bowl first.
Player Turns: Each player takes turns to bat and bowl, with each ball's outcome determined by random scoring and the player's input.
Interactive Gameplay: The players predict the opponent's score to avoid getting "out" and score as many runs as possible.
Database Integration: Player statistics, such as total matches played, matches won, average scores, highest scores, and lowest scores, are stored in a MySQL database for record-keeping and analysis.
Score Tracking and Results Calculation: The game calculates and displays the final scores for both players, declaring the winner based on performance.
